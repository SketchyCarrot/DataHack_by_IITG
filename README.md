# DataHack_by_IITG
Data Analytics and Machine Learning Hackathon

# "Final_Submission.csv" is my submission for this hackathon.
There are three columns in the file,
respondent_id, xyz_vaccine, seasonal_vaccine in sequence.

I worked on "main.ipynb" file. I have used Random Tree Classifier model, which has been trained to predict with an accuracy of roughly ~ 80%.

The rest of the files are to be ignored. They are the csv files provided with the Problem Statement.
